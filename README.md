Scholdoc-Types: document structure for Scholdoc
===============================================

**Current version:** 0.1.3

This project contains definitions of the document structure used for
[Scholdoc][scholdoc], a fork of Pandoc that understands [Scholarly Markdown][scholmd]. This package is a fork of [Pandoc-Types][pandoc-types]
intended to support the development of [Scholdoc][scholdoc]. It includes some
non-trivial extensions to the Pandoc data types and builder functions that are
not easily implemented by depending on and extending the
[Pandoc-Types][pandoc-types] modules.

This package is currently up to date with [Pandoc-Types][pandoc-types] version
1.12.4
